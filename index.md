# Information

Based on my learnings and course of Machine Learning, where I studied different steps to follow in a Machine learning problem such as finding approprate columns, handling missing data, fixing categorical columns and using different ways to test the data based on our initial assumptions and finally applying XGBoost to predict the output. 

I also created a pipeline to handle things such as preprocessing and then calculating the output for the test data.

The score I got was 14997.99107, which is kind of amazing considering this is my first Machine Learning Model. I got a rank of 1719 for the same.
